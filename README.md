## ‚ú® Key Features

### üîê Security & Encryption
* **100% Offline:** All data is stored locally on your device in a secure SQLite database. Your data never leaves your phone.
* **End-to-End Encryption:** All sensitive account information (especially passwords) is encrypted using the powerful **AES-256** algorithm.
* **Zero Knowledge Model:** Your master password is **hashed** for verification and is **never stored**. It's the key to unlock your vault and exists only in your memory.
* **Session-Based Security:** The encryption key is derived from your master password only when you need it and is cleared from memory when the app is closed.
* **Biometric App Lock:** Use your device's fingerprint or Face ID for quick and convenient access to the app.
* **Customizable Auto-Lock Timer:** For added security, the app automatically locks the vault if left in the background. The timer duration is fully customizable by the user.
* **Permanent Data Deletion:** Securely delete your entire user profile and all associated data with master password confirmation.

### üóÇÔ∏è Organization & Management
* **Custom Categories:** Create, edit, and delete your own custom categories.
* **Multi-Select & Batch Delete:** Easily select multiple categories at once to delete them in a single action.
* **Drag & Drop Reordering:** Intuitively reorder accounts *within* their category and reorder entire categories on the management screen.
* **Full Account CRUD:** Create, view, edit, and delete account credentials with an intuitive UI.
* **Real-time Search:** Instantly find any account by searching for its service name or username.
* **Slidable Actions:** Quickly edit or delete accounts with modern swipe gestures.
* **Password Generator:** Create strong, unique, and customizable passwords directly within the app.
* **Password Strength Meter:** Get real-time feedback on the strength of your passwords as you type.

### üé® Personalization & Accessibility
* **Adaptive Theming:** The entire app is beautifully themed. Users can manually switch between **Light**, **Dark**, and **System default** themes from the settings screen for a personalized visual experience.
* **Full Localization (i18n):** Complete support for both **English** and **Arabic**, including Right-to-Left (RTL) layouts. The app automatically detects the device language but allows the user to manually override it.

### üîÑ Data Portability
* **Export to Excel:** Securely back up your vault by exporting it to an organized Excel (`.xlsx`) file. Passwords are **decrypted** for this export to ensure the backup is readable.
* **Import from Excel:** Easily restore your data from a backup file. Passwords from the file are **re-encrypted** on import with your current master password.
